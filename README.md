# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
 Due to cashless transactions every person uses an ATM card and
Credit card for transactions. So, Frauds can also be increased.
Billions of dollars of loss are caused every year by fraudulent credit
card transactions. The design of efficient fraud detection algorithms is
key for reducing these losses, and more and more algorithms rely on
advanced machine learning techniques to assist fraud investigators.
